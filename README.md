QuickSort.Java : Quicksort a Fq of file in alphabaetic order using a 2D array.

Kmeans.Java : Unsupervised clustering of bacterial and archeal genomes based on
              on the normalized amino acid compsitions.

Needleman-Wunch (NW.java) : instastiate a global sequence alignment to align fasta
                            sequences of DNA,RNA or protein
                            
Position Specific Scoring Matrix(PSSM.java): The position specific scoring matrix is a 
                          supervised motif finding method for TF binding sites.
Gibbs Sampler for Motif Finding (GS.java): In this project we will use unsupervised motif 
                          determination by sampling DNA sequences for an optimal recurrent
                          motif generated in a ChIP-Seq experiment. The motif window size,
                          motif sequence and motif position in each of the ChIP sequences
                          will be returned.
